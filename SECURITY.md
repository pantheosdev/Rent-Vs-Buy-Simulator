## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, open a private report to the maintainers (recommended: GitHub Security Advisories) with:
- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment

We will respond as quickly as practical and coordinate a fix/release.
